<img src="./.resources/.assets/PWM_logo_small.png?raw=true" width="96"> - **Leave a star ‚≠ê if you like this project üôÇ thank you.**

**|Easy automatic multi app passive income project with Webdasboard, Auto Updater and Proxy Support :dollar::satisfied::+1:|**

## Quick Overview üöÄ
**PassiveWebMoney** leverages unused internet bandwidth allowing you to make money with something you have and would otherwise be wasted.** It utilizes containerized version of apps like EarnApp, Honeygain, IPRoyal Pawns, PacketStream, Peer2Profit, Repocket, Earnfm, Proxyrack, Proxylite, Bitping and so on but it's also safer than installing and using these native apps on your host system.

‚ú® **Key Features:**
- **Multiplatform** and lightweight docker stack.
- **Automatic Updates** to keep your applications up-to-date.
- **Web Dashboard** for easy monitoring.
- **Proxy Support** for enhanced flexibility.

üåê For a detailed overview and FAQ, visit the [Wiki](https://github.com/IncasedDevelopment/passivewebmoney/wiki) or join our [Discord Community](#-join-the-passivewebmoney-community-on-discord).

## Getting Started üö•
### Prerequisites
- Ensure that you have a 64-bit operating system, virtualization functions are enabled and Docker is installed and able to auto start up on system boot.
- (Optional) For ARM devices like Raspberry Pi, installing an emulation layer for non-ARM native Docker images is recommended. Even though the script can assist with the installation, we recommend users to install an emulation layer by themselves following the [Wiki](https://github.com/IncasedDevelopment/passivewebmoney/wiki) guide.
- (Optional) On Windows, ensure the Virtualization platform and Windows Subsystem for Linux are active as Docker requires these features. Even though the script can assist with the installation, we recommend users to enable these windows functions by themselves following the [Wiki](https://github.com/IncasedDevelopment/passivewebmoney/wiki) guide.


### Quick Setup Guide
1. **Download** the latest version of PassiveWebMoney from the [Releases](https://github.com/IncasedDevelopment/passivewebmoney/releases) or git clone the project.
   - OR you can also use on Linux/MacOS a bash command like: `wget https://github.com/IncasedDevelopment/passivewebmoney/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && unzip main.zip`
   - OR on Windows use a pwsh command like:`Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://github.com/IncasedDevelopment/passivewebmoney/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -OutFile main.zip; Expand-Archive -Path main.zip -DestinationPath .\ `
3. **Register** accounts on the application websites. [Here's a list of availabe apps](#app-compatibility-and-sign-up-links-)
4. **Run** the guided setup:
   - **Linux:** 
     ```bash
     sudo chmod +x runme.sh && ./runme.sh 
     ```
   - **Windows:**
     ```powershell
     Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Force; .\runme.ps1 
     ```
5. **Start Earning** passively and monitor your performance through the web dashboard.

## Scale Up with Multi-Proxy Support üåê

**PassiveWebMoney** has the ability to create multiple instances also using a proxy list, ideal for scaling up your setup. Quickly set up numerous instances each linked to a different proxy with ease.

### Getting Started with Multi-Proxy
- **Initial Setup**: First, set up the main instance using `runme.sh` with a proxy.
- **Prepare Proxies**: Create a `proxies.txt` in the root folder, listing each remaning proxy on a separate line and ending with a new line.

### Launching Multiple Instances
1. **Run the Script**: Use the "Setup and manage multiproxy instances by list" in the PWM menu or execute `runmproxies` script in the terminal. This script intelligently handles existing instances by offering to:
   - Clear and recreate all instances.
   - Update proxies for existing setups (if sufficient proxies are available).
   - Exit without changes.

2. **Automated Setup**: For each proxy in `proxies.txt`, the script sets up a new instance with appropriate configurations.

> **Notice**: While using multiple proxies, be aware that only certain apps permit proxy usage per their ToS. We recommend using personal, private proxies with IPs not flagged as proxies and always respecting the ToS of each app.

## Compatibility and tested environments
This Docker Stack should work on anything that may have docker installed. In particular, it has been tested on: 
| | Windows 11 x86_64\amd64 | Linux Ubuntu x86_64\amd64 | Raspbian OS arm64 | MacOS Intel x86_64 | MacOS silicon arm64 | 
|  :---: |  :---: |  :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
